# Changelog

All notable changes to kōboku are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), the added/changed/fixed/removed headings
match Conventional Commits types, and this project adheres to semantic versioning from the first
release.

The **Unreleased** section describes the product as it will be at v1: what a reader gets when the
milestones below are complete. Each completed milestone is recorded as its own versioned section,
with the date and the tests that proved it.

## Unreleased — planned scope of v1

The scope of v1, as planned: a local, single-user agent harness with a browser chat page and a trace
inspector page. Tools are recorded under this heading as they are implemented, not before.

### Toolchain

- TanStack Start on Vite and React, Node target only. Tailwind CSS and shadcn carry the styling; the
  starter theme and its remote font import were removed, leaving Tailwind plus the shadcn tokens.
- Commands `npm run dev`, `test`, `typecheck`, `lint` and `fmt`. Lint is oxlint and format is oxfmt;
  the scaffold's biome/eslint toolchain was declined at creation time.
- TypeScript strict including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Tests run through a separate
  `vitest.config.ts` so that they do not load the Start plugin.
- Configuration is read from `process.env` and validated with zod. Non-secret `KOBOKU_*` values live
  in the committed `.env`, the provider key belongs in git-ignored `.env.local`, and `.env.example`
  lists every key with no values.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-11-06 — M0

The Provider seam exists, and both halves of the M0 exit test pass.

### Added

- `src/harness/types.ts` — `Message`, `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, `StopReason`, `TokenUsage`,
  `AssistantTurn`. Hand-written: no SDK defines these shapes.
- `src/harness/provider/provider.ts` — the `Provider` interface. One `generate()` call: a message list
  and a tool list in, one assistant turn out.
- `src/harness/provider/fake.ts` — a scripted provider with the same interface. It records every
  request it receives and raises `RangeError` rather than invent a turn it was not given.
- `src/harness/provider/strata.ts` — the real adapter: hand-written OpenAI-compatible request and
  response shapes, validated with zod. A `finish_reason` outside `stop`, `tool_calls` or `length`
  raises an error naming the value.
- `src/harness/config.ts` — environment reading validated with zod. A failure names the offending keys
  and the rules they broke, never the values.
- `src/agent.functions.ts` — the server-function bridge, and a page at `/` that calls it.

### Exit test, both halves

- Vitest half: `npm run test`, 2026-11-06 — 1 file, 4 tests passed in 174 ms, no model server and no
  network.
- Server-function half: `npm run dev`, 2026-11-06 — a click on the page, and the browser network log
  showing `GET /_serverFn/…` returning 200 in 72 ms. The page rendered the same canned reply the test
  asserts.

### Gaps recorded at M0

- `strata.ts` sends `tool_call_id` on tool messages but does not yet send an assistant message that
  carries tool calls. Nothing produces one until the loop exists at M1.
- A request to a path with no route logs `notFoundError` on `__root__` and renders TanStack Router's
  generic Not Found; no `defaultNotFoundComponent` is configured. The offending path was not
  identified. Dev server log, 2026-11-06.
- No `.env.local` exists, so `config.ts` has never run and Strata has never been contacted. Deliberate:
  M0 must pass with no key.
- No loop, no tools, no jail, no traces. `HarnessEvent` is not defined; it arrives with the loop at M1.
